## Project Structure

The project follows a structured organization to maintain clarity and ease of navigation. Key directories include:

### src/components: Contains reusable React components for building the user interface.

### src/pages: Houses individual pages/routes of the application.

### src/firebase: Stores Firebase configuration and utility functions for authentication and database interactions.

### src/styles: Includes global styles and theme configurations for consistent styling across the application.

### public: Contains static assets such as images and favicon.

## Implementation Details

### Authentication

The application utilizes Firebase Authentication for user authentication. Users can sign up with email/password or log in with existing credentials. Upon successful authentication, users gain access to calendar functionalities based on their permissions.

### Real-Time Database

Firebase Realtime Database powers the backend of the application, enabling real-time synchronization of calendar events across multiple users. The database structure is designed to efficiently store and retrieve event data while maintaining data integrity and security.

### User Interface

The user interface is built using React.js and Material-UI components to ensure a responsive and visually appealing design. Features include:

#### Calendar view with month, week, and day views.

#### Event creation, editing, and deletion functionalities.

#### User-friendly forms for input validation and error handling.

#### Intuitive navigation and user feedback mechanisms.

## Usage Instructions

1. User Registration/Login: Users can sign up for an account or log in with existing credentials using the provided authentication form.

2. Calendar Navigation: Navigate between different views (month, week, day) to visualize events within specific time frames.

3. Event Management: Create new events by clicking on the desired date and filling out the event details form. Edit or delete existing events by selecting them from the calendar interface.

4. Collaboration: Share calendars with other users and collaborate on event planning and scheduling.

5. Settings: Access user settings to customize preferences, manage account information, and configure notification preferences.

# Description of Progress

## Engage: Explored existing calendar applications, identified user needs, and outlined project goals.

## Investigate: Researched technologies and frameworks suitable for building a multi-user calendar. Decided to use React.js for the front end and Firebase for the real-time database and authentication.

## Act: Implemented user authentication, calendar view functionality, event creation, and editing features. Addressed challenges related to real-time data synchronization and user permissions.

# Algorithm Description

The calendar application utilizes algorithms to manage event scheduling, collision detection, and user notifications. It employs data structures such as arrays and objects to organize events and optimize calendar display. Additionally, algorithms for user authentication and authorization ensure secure access to calendar functionalities.

By adhering to this documentation structure, users can easily understand and utilize the multi-user calendar application. It serves as a valuable resource for both individual reflection and collaborative development efforts.
